\# CS 271 - Assembly Language Portfolio



This repository contains a curated set of x86 assembly language projects completed for CS 271 (Assembly Language) at Oregon State University.



\## Topics Covered

\- x86 Assembly (MASM)

\- Stack-based procedures

\- Register and memory management

\- String processing and validation

\- Control flow and arithmetic operations



\## Project Structure

Each project folder contains:

\- `main.asm`: the assembly source code

\- `README.md`: a brief explanation of the problem and approach



These projects demonstrate low-level programming fundamentals and explicit control over memory and execution flow without reliance on high-level abstractions.
