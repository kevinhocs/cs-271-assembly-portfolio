\## Project 4 - Pascal’s Triangle Generator



x86 assembly program that validates user input and generates Pascal’s Triangle up to a user-specified number of rows using explicit binomial coefficient computation.



\### Concepts

\- Input validation and controlled user interaction

\- Modular procedure design with clear separation of concerns

\- Iterative computation of binomial coefficients (n choose k)

\- Nested loop control for structured output generation

\- Arithmetic operations and register management in assembly
