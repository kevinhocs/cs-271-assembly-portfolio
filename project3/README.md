\## Project - Chaotic Temperature Statistics



x86 assembly program that generates a 2D array of random temperature data and computes daily highs, daily lows, and truncated averages across multiple days.



\### Concepts

\- 2D array indexing and pointer arithmetic

\- Modular procedures with stack-based parameters

\- Iterative min/max computation

\- Aggregate calculations with integer division
